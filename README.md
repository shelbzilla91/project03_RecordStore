**Process**
I have to say this was the hardest project yet. I had trouble understanding the connecting of the front and back end through axios/react. I started out wanting to do a full ons hopping app for vinyl records, but realized that a post/sell concept was better. I was able to get two models working and hard-learned the many concepts on both ends. I got the hang of styled-components and dabbed in some bootstrap. I wanted to add a third model of comments, but found myself out of time. Although React was challenging, and also brushing up on CRUD again, I think it was a good head-dive towards project four. 




**Second Round**

<p>There are some things in my icebox,because time is always a flaw I am working harder on.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to add a shopping cart option, so users would not have to go by their email for contact and sale.</li>
<li>I would allow comments under records, for users to share more musical interests.</li>
<li>I would spend more time diving into using other css frameworks besides Bootstrap, I want to practice more with styled-components to have more creative freedom.</li>
</ul>
