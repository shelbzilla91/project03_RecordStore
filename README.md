#Second Round

<p>There are some things in my icebox,because time is always a flaw I am working harder on.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I want to add a shopping cart option, so users would not have to go by their email for contact and sale.</li>
<li>I would allow comments under records, for users to share more musical interests.</li>
<li>I would spend more time diving into using other css frameworks besides Bootstrap, I want to practice more with styled-components to have more creative freedom.</li>
</ul>
